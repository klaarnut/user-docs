RVsitebuilder 7 is the plugable application that allows several Apps to install on it and use with your website.
Long story short, it allows you to install Apps from our [Apps Marketplace](https://apps.rvsitebuilder.com) to use on your website aside from cool features we already provide in RVsitebuilder.

But in case if sometimes you really want to add Javascript/Css on your page in order to make your website more wow, you can also do that in our **HTML Mode**.

## Add CSS/Javascript by page
